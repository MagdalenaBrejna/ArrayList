## About
The ArrayList is a simulation of company hiring workers and officials. All of them are saved in the ArrayList. Inner classes (comparators) let methods returrn lists of employees 
sorted by the given feature (e.g. name or age). The program uses different ArrayList features (e.g. interators) and generic methods.
